# RyallsWarming
Control system for small radiant warming system
The system comprises of 12 frames 1.5m x 1.5m which are height adjustable. Six of the plots are controls while the other six have 1000W ceramic heat lamps and control units to monitor and regulate the temperature. The control units are built using Arduino Nano micro controllers built as modbus slaves. Each controller has an infrared temperature sensor which monitors the surface temperature of the target 1m2 of the plot. A central control module (Campbell CR1000 data logger) polls each plot to obtain its temperature. It calculates the average of the ambient plots then sends each warmed plot a setpoint value (usually ambient + an offset). The individual plot controllers attempt to regulate the plot temperature by varying the power to its heater using a PID control loop and PWM of the power to the heater via a solid state relay.
